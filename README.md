## Branch Instructions
### How to git branch
1. First: git clone the repo
2. Make sure to do a ```git pull``` to get the latest from the master branch
3. To create a new branch copy from master: ```git checkout -b yourbranchname```
4. Once you have added and committed something, you can push up the branch with: ```git push --set-upstream origin yourbranchname```
5. To view all the available branches: ```git branch```
6. To switch back to master: ```git checkout master```. (Note: You will need to make sure any uncommitted changes are committed in your current branch before switching.)

### How to update your branch with master branch
1. First update master: ```git checkout master```
2. Pull into master ```git pull``` from master branch
3. Check back into your branch: ```git checkout yourbranchname```
4. To merge master into your current branch: ```git merge master``` (NOTE BE CAREFUL. If any of the same files were changed concurrently on your branch and master, you will need to manually resolve merge conflicts).
