In order to run tests locally, type command:
PYTHONPATH=. py.test --cov pype --cov-report term-missing
(otherwise pytest will only show timeseries, and not pype - likely some bug because the parent directory is the same name as the timeseries module. Note that changing the source in .coveragerc does not help)
